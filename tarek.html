      <h2>The Benefits Islam Brought to Spain</h2>
      <p>The agricultural system of the Spanish Muslims was "the most complex, the most scientific, the most perfect, ever devised by the ingenuity of man." Glick supports this by outlining that the Muslims introduced many transformations. A further sign of the Islamic land revolution was that while the rest of Europe crumbled under serfdom and slave labor, the land under Islam was granted to tilling farmers. Under Andalusian Arabs, Joseph McCabe remarked that "great estates tilled by serfs and slaves were rare. Along the course of the Guadalquivir alone, there were 12,000 happy villages."</p>
